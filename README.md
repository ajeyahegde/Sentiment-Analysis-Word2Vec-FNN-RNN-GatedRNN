# Sentiment-Analysis-Word2Vec-FNN-RNN-GatedRNN

## Sentiment Analysis using Word2Vec for feature extraction and Feed Forward Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks &amp; Gated Recurrent Neural Networks

**### This project involves following steps:**

1. Read Amazon Reviews data into Pandas dataframe

2. Data Cleaning

3. Feature Extraction using Google News Word2Vec model 

4. Train custom Word2Vec model using read data

5. Comparing vector operations semantic similarity between Google Word2Vec vectors and custom Word2Vec vectors

6. Train Perceptron and Support Vector Models using Word2Vec features and compare with Perceptron and SVM models trained on TF-IDF features.

7. DataSet preparation and Data loading for Neural Networks

8. Train Feed-Forward Neural Network, Recurrent Neural Network and Gated Recurrent Neural Network using Train dataset.

9. Predict the sentiment rating values for test dataset.

10. Compare the accuracy for all the neural network models.
